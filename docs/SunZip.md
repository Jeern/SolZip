# SunZip - The Command Line tool

SunZip.exe has changed its name to [SolZip.exe](SolZip.exe).

A kind soul told me that the name SunZip sounded too much like Unzip which is clearly not the intend, so I took a quick decision and changed the name to [SolZip.exe](SolZip.exe)(SolZip.exe). You can read about the new and improved Commandline tool on its own page [SolZip.exe](SolZip.exe)(SolZip.exe)
